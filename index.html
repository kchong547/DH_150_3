        <h1>A little about me...</h1>

        <p>My name is Katherine Chong and I'm a third year pursuing
          computer science at <a href='https://www.ucla.edu/' target="_blank">University of California Los Angeles.</a>
          I really love utilizing my imagination and bringing my thoughts to life,
          whether it be through drawing or coding. I'm happiest when I'm blending
          my creative abilities and my interest in tech together to create something
          new and exciting! I think one of the most intriguing things about computer science is
          its infinite possibilies and applications, which makes it easy to blend with any interests.</p>

        <p>Creating an impact in a community or in someone's life is a goal I hold dear to my heart.
            Currently, I'm the External Vice President for <a href='https://www.uclaacm.com/' target="blank">Association for Computing Machinery (ACM at UCLA)</a>,
            the largest computer science student organization at UCLA for the 2020-2021 term.
            I'm also involved in <a href='http://www.exploretech.la/' target="blank">exploretech.la</a>, a student-led organization
            that aims to expose underserved Title 1 high school students in LAUSD to opportunities in technology.
            Find out more about what I do in these orgs <a href='about.html'>here</a>!</p>

        <p>When I'm not occupied by academics or coding, I enjoy testing the limits of my
          artistic ability. Take a look some of my recent <a href='art-design.html'>art</a> and <a href='projects.html'>projects</a>!
          In my free time, I also love being inspired by music, watching shows, reading books,
          or taking a nice walk outdoors.</p>
