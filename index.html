        <h1 id="about-me">A little about me...</h1>

        <p>My name is Katherine Chong and I'm a third year college student pursuing my B.S. in
          computer science. I'm extremely thankful to have the opportunity to be a part of the bruin family
          at the <a href='https://www.ucla.edu/' target="_blank">University of California Los Angeles.</a> </p>

        <p>I think one of the most intriguing things about computer science is
        its infinite possibilies and applications. I'm just starting to explore the vast world of computer
        science but it's better late than never!
        Currently, I've got a keen interest in web development, games, and backend development and I'm
        excited to see where my interests take me!</p>

          <p>What motivates me is seeing my colorful imagination and thoughts being brought to life,
          whether it be through coding, drawing, and much more. I'm happiest when I'm blending
          my creative abilities and my interest in tech together to create something
          new and exciting!</p>

        <p>Creating a positive impact wherever I go is a goal I hold dear to my heart.
           Being welcomed in a supportive community has brought me so much joy throughout my life.
           Throughout my time at UCLA, I've been fortunate to be able to contribute
           to many groups filled with amazing people, such as the
           <a href='https://www.uclaacm.com/' target="blank">Association for Computing Machinery (ACM at UCLA)</a>
           and <a href='http://www.exploretech.la/' target="blank">exploretech.la</a>.
           I'd love nothing more than to give back and help bring these communities to greater heights than before. </p>

              is the largest computer science student organization at UCLA.
              As the External Vice President for the 2020-2021 term, I maintain social media, finances,
              corporate relations, and cross-organization partnerships along with my 4 person team</p>

        <p>Sometimes I beep boop bop away on my computer. Here are a few things I've worked on:</p>

          <div class='involvements top'>
            <img src='images/website.png' class='article-image'/>
            <ul>
              <li><h2> This website! </h2></li>
              <li></br></li>
              <li><p>Besides the logos, all of the drawings and assets were created by me
              with Clip Studio Paint and Figma. It was molded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, time, and a lot of love.
              My biggest inspiration was trying to find a balance between making a personal website and a drawing.
              If anything, I wanted it to be a functional art piece that showed who I am.</p></li>

               <li><h2> 49 Cleaners </h2></li>
               <li></br></li>
               <li><p>49 Cleaners is designed to be an order and delivery service for laundromat services.
                 Its still in progress! So far, I've designed and implemented the front-end of web page with WordPress, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                 Currently I'm developing a secure log-in page with a database with PHP and SQL.</p></li>

               <li><p>Night in the Diner is an interactive, point and click game written in JavaScript.
                      Overall, I led the artistic vision and product planning by producing bird's-eye view
                      floor plans and coordinating color schemes. I also created various 3D objects in blender,
                      produced object textures in Clip Studio Paint, and helped place items/maintain code with JavaScript. </p></li>

               <li><p>A small project I did with where I trained a SensorTile to recognize
                 6 different states using gyroscope and accelerometer sensors. The code to recognize

        <h1 id="more-me">What do I do in my free time?</h1>
        <p>When I'm not occupied by academics or coding, I enjoy testing the limits of my
          artistic ability. I love mixing elements of fantasy and design to create unique characters and pieces.
          As someone with a very expressive face, incorporating emotions through facial expressions in my work is something I strive to do.

          <p>You can often see me jamming out to music while I'm productive as it often influences my work, especially
            my drawings. In my free time, I'm usually binging video games, TV shows, and books.
            I'm also down to explore exciting food places around my area with friends; It only takes a few bites to get me out of my shell!</p>
